         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <p>Neither can there be any ſuch collection made out of this Text, that all Sectaries, ſchiſmatiques, heretiques ſhould profeſſe what they liſt without reſtraint: no more then from hence may be proued that all Thiefes, murderers and other malefactours ſhould be permitted to robbe and ſley without pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment or contradiction.</p>
               <p>Chriſt proteſteth that he came not to abrogate the Law, but to fulfill it. <hi>Matth.</hi> 5. But God in his Law commandeth that the Falſe-Prophet, and the ſeducing Idolater ſhould be put to death; as we haue declared before.</p>
               <p>Alſo, Chriſt manfully oppoſed himſelfe againſt the Scribes and Phariſies, and willed euery man to beware of them.

               <p>Againe, the ſword is therefore deliuered vnto the Magiſtrate, that he ſhould execute Gods wrath and vengeance vpon all euill doers.</p>
               <p>Moreouer in this Parable Chriſt ſpeaketh not ſimply, that the Tares are not to be rooted out, but addeth the reaſon, <hi>Leaſt while you go to gather the tares, you plucke vp alſo with them the wheate.

Therefore whatſoeuer deſtroyeth or hurteth the wheat, that is to be plucked vp, and remoued from the wheate, becauſe it is hurtfull vnto it.

               <p>Chriſt ſuffereth the Goates in his fold together with his Sheepe, but hath ſpeciall care they do not hurt them. If a Wolfe ſhould come among the flocke into the ſheepe-coate, ought not a good Sheepheard to chaſe him away and to keepe the Sheepe from being worried?</p>

               <p>In the beginning of Queene <hi>Elizabeth</hi> her moſt bleſſed and happie raigne, the Popiſh Biſhops and greateſt Clerks were prouoked and appointed by auctoritie to diſpute, if they were able to maintaine their doctrine againſt the Miniſters of the Goſpell; But after a few impertinent words, they gaue ouer their cauſe in the plaine field, and ſo ridiculouſly

The King of Nauarre being aduertiſed of theſe proceedings, complaineth vnto the King of the peace he had made with the League, declaring vnto him that himſelfe could not be ignorant, that he had made peace with his Enemies, and armed them with his forces and auctoritie againſt the Eſtate, againſt the Blood, and againſt his owne Perſon.
